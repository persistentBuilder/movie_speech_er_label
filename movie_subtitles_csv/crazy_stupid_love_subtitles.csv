647,She's just looking for an opportunity to settle for a responsible and stable adult.
648,And I'd like her to settle for you.
649,"Oh. Well, thank you for the ego boost, but you know what"

1506,"Look, Cal, it's not something that I wanted, okay"
1507,I looked at people who were in love
1508,and I thought the way that they were behaving
1509,and the things that they were doing and saying
1510,"they appeared pathetic, honestly."
1511,"And I spent all this time with you, I'm trying to make you more like me"

1540,"And now, to introduce our first student speaker"
1541,our very own Kate Tafferty.
1542, She's pretty.  Ugh.
1543,Our first speaker is not only the class salutatorian
1544,but is also
1545,one of the most spirited young men
1546,I've ever had the pleasure of teaching.
1547,"Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver."
1548, Whoo  Robbie
1549,"Welcome, class of 2011."
1550,Our time as middle schoolers has come to an end.
1551,We can't fight it anymore. We're getting old.
1552,All my life I wanted to grow up.
1553,I wanted to grow older so people would take me seriously.
1554,It all sounded so good to me.
1555,"Growing up, getting a job, getting married."
1556,But
1557,it's all a scam.
1558,And love
1559,That's the biggest scam of all.
1560,I was in love.
1561,And I know that makes some of you laugh because I'm only 13
1562,but whatever. I was.
1563,"And I used to think, and really believe"
1564,that there was one true love for everyone
1565,and if you fought hard enough for that person
1566,your one true love would always work out.
1567,"It sounded good to me when I was younger, but it just doesn't work that way."
1568, There is no such thing as one true love  Stop.
1569,Shit.
1570," Oh, boy.  Okay."
1571,All right. Ahem. Excuse me.
1572,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
1573, What are you doing  What are you doing
1574,"I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as"
1575,"I, uh"
1576,Um
1577,"Oh. Well, here's the thing:"
1578,My son's graduation speech sucks.
1579,That's not a joke.
1580,"In fairness, I didn't know where he was going with that."
1581,But I think we can all agree
1582,"it was headed in a kind of depressing, um, way."
1583,"My son Not him, my actual son."
1584, Believes in grand romantic gestures.
1585,He believes in the existence
1586,of one's soul mate.
1587,And it's easy to just look at a 13yearold and say:
1588,"""You don't know what you're talking about. You are wrong. """
1589,But I'm not so sure.
1590,I met my soul mate when I was 15 years old.
1591,We went out for ice cream.
1592,"After, my dad started teasing me about my first date, the way dads do."
1593,"And I told him, ""Dad, it's no big deal."
1594,"I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different girls on a lot of different dates. """
1595,And that is the first time that I ever lied to my father.
1596,I met my soul mate when I was 15 years old
1597,and I have loved her every minute of every day
1598,since I first bought her that mint chocolate chip cone.
1599,I have loved her through the birth of my three perfect children.
1600,I have loved her even when I've hated her.
1601,Only married couples will understand that one.
1602,And I don't know if it's gonna work out.
1603,I don't know what's gonna happen.
1604,"I'm sorry, Robbie, I can't give you that."
1605,But I can promise you this:
1606,I will never stop trying.
1607,Because when you find the one
1608,you never give up.
1609,Do you have anything you'd like to say
1610,"I still love you, Jessica."
1611,"And I love you, Emily."
1612,I loved you ever since you first changed my sister's diaper.
1613,I loved you when you came into my bedroom and I was under the covers
1614," Stop him. No, no."
1615, What's he talking about  I'm not ashamed of it.
1616,"Okay, we're good, we're good."
1617,"Oh, there's your mom. Let's go say hi."
1618,Hey.
1619,"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
1620,There she is. My perfect girl.
1621,Hi.
1622,Okay.
1623,So I bought a firearm
1624,from a shady Internet site
1625,and I am prepared to shoot you with it.
1626,Come here.
1627,Take care of her.
1628,This is gonna be fun.
1629,This is gonna be fun.
1630,I'm gonna talk to my friends.
1631,"Go hang with the other high schoolers. Go ahead, see if I care. I don't care."
1632,I'm really glad you came.
1633,So am I.
1634,"You were a really good babysitter, Jessica."
1635,I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
1636, I thought you weren't giving up. I'm not.
1637,But I just figure
1638,you like my dad
1639,and in a few years I'll look like him.
1640,I'll come for you then.
1641,That's not a bad plan.
1642,But
1643,"Well, until then"
1644,just a little graduation gift to get you through high school.
1645,Thanks.
1646,So
1647,Can you
1648," Why  Take care, Robbie."
1649,Holy crap.
1650, He looks pretty happy.  Yeah.
1651," God, I hate that haircut, though.  Ick."
1652, I know. He looks like a sheepdog.  Mmhm.
1653,"Oh, my eyes My eyes My eyes"
1654,It's been a really hard year.
1655,How so
1656,"Yeah, there were a couple little blips, I guess."
1657," I know.  I guess I just, you know"
1658,Really what I want to say
1659,is that I'm so glad you bought me that ice cream.
1660,Me too.
