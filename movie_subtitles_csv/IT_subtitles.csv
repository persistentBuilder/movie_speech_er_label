586,It is more dangerous and unpleasant.
587, What do you mean it's more dangerous  It smells of urine and is disgusting.
588,All right. Can you tell me exactly what she said
589,Just you guys need to hurry over.
590, Good.  Good.

595,"Shut up Just shut up, Richie."
596,My dad will kill me if he finds out that I had boys in the apartment.
597,Wwwwwe'll leave a lookout.
598,"Now Richie, just stay here."

601,It is a gift.
602,In there
603,What is it
604,You'll see.
605,"Great, bringing us to the bathroom."
606,You know that 89% of the worse accidents
607,occur in the bathroom and kitchen
608,And that's where all the bacteria and fungi are 
609,and it is not a hygienic place 
610,I knew it
611,Do you see it
612,Yes.
613,What happened in here
614,"My dad couldn't see it, I thought that I might be crazy."
615,"Well if you're crazy, then we're all crazy."
616,We ccccan't leave it like this.
617,You never went to the Summer Fair Derry
618,"No, I think not."
619,That I know.
620,I go every year 
621,but once I went with Richie and I won because I hit the target.
622,But there were so many prizes I didn't know which one to choose.
623,"It's not true, you know"
624,What they say about me.
625,I was only ever kissed by one guy.
626,It was a long time ago.
627,But it was a nice kiss though.
628,"""January embers"""
629,Wwwwwas that in the play
630,"No, the poem."
631,"Oh, I really don't read much pppoetry."
632,"Oh I just,"
633,never mind.
634,"Oh, just so you know,"
635,I never believed any of the rumors.
636,None of us losers do.
637,We like hanging with you.
638,Thanks.
639,You should not thank us too much
640,hanging out with us makes you a loser too.
641,I can take that.
642,"No, I love being your personal doorman."
643,Really could you idiots have taken any longer
644," Shut up, Richie.  Yeah, shut up, Richie."
645,"Oh okay, trash the trashmouth, I get it."
646,Hey I wasn't the one scrubbing the bathroom floor
647,imagining that her sink went all Eddie's mom's vagina on halloween.
648,She didn't imagine.
649,I also saw something too.
650,"You saw blood, too"
651,"Not blood,"
652,I saw GgGeorgie.
653,"It seemed so real,"
654,I mean it seemed like him but there was this
655,A clown.
656,"Yeah, I saw him too."
657,"Wait, can only virgins see this stuff"
658,Is that why I'm not. seeing this shit

679,You losers are trying too hard.
680,"She'll do you,"

684,"Come on, get him"
685,ROCK WAR
686, Give them hard  Watch out
687,"Drop dead, you fuckers."
688,Eddie

692,Come on guys  Harder
693,"Go to the hell, losers"
694,"GO BLOW YOUR DAD, YOU MULLETWEARING ASSHOLE"
695,"Thanks guys, but you shouldn't have done that,"
696,he'll be after you guys too now.
697,"Ah, now Bowers, he's always after us."
698,I guess that's one thththing we all have in common.
699,"Yes son, welcome to the loser's club."
700,Here.
701,They said they found part of his hand all chewed up near the standpipe.
702,He asked to borrow a pencil once.
703,It's like she's been fffforgotten
704,because Corcoran's missing.
705,Is it ever gonna end
706,"What the fuck, dude"
707,What are you guys talking about
708,What they always talk about.
709,"I actually think it will end,"
710,"for a little while, at least."
711,What do you mean
712,So I was going over all of my data research
713,and I charted out all of the big events
714,The Ironworks explosion in 1908
715,The Bradley Gang in '35
716,and The Black Spot in '62.
717,And now the kids being
718,I realized that this stuff seems to happen
719,(Bill and Ben) every 27 years.
720,Ok so let me get this straight
721,IT comes out from wherever to eat kids for like a year
722,and then what IT just goes into hibernation
723,Maybe it's like  What do you call it
724,Cicadas.
725,"You know, the bugs that come out once every 17 years."
726,My grandfather thinks this town is cursed
727,He says
728,that all the bad things that happened in this town
729,are because of one thing
730,An evil thing that feeds off the people of Derry.
731,But it can't be one thing.
732,We all saw something different.
733,Maybe
734,Or maybe IT knows what scares us most and that's what we see.
735,II saw a leper.
736,He was like a walking infection.
737,But you didn't
738,Because IT isn't real.
739,None of this is.
740,Not Eddie's leper
741,or Bill seeing Georgie
742,or the woman I keep seeing.
743,Is she hot
744,No. Richie.
745,She's not hot
746,Her face is all messed up.
747,None of this makes any sense.
748,They're all like bad dreams.
749,"I don't think so, I know the difference between a bad dream and real life, okay"
750,What did you see You saw something too
751,Yes.
752,You guys know that burnt down house on Harris Avenue
753,I was inside when it burned down
754,Before I rescued 
755,my mom and dad were trapped in the next room over from me.
756,They were pushing and pounding on the door
757,trying to get to me.
758,"Hurry up, son"
759,I'm burning
760,But it was too hot
761,When firefighters found them
762,the skin on their hands melted down to the bone.
763,We're all afraid of something.
764,got that right.
765,Why Rich What are you afraid of
766,Clowns.
767,Okay.
768,Look.
769,Storm drain
770,"That's were Georgie disappeared,"
771,"there's the Ironworks,"
772,and the Black Spot.
773,Everywhere IT happens it'sit's all connected by the sewers
774,and they all meet up at the
775,(Ben) the wellhouse.
776,You mean the house on Neibolt Street
777,You mean the creepyass house where all the junkies and hobos like to sleep
778,I hate that place.
779,Always feels like it's watching me.
780,That's where I saw IT
781,There I saw a clown.
782,Thathathathat's where IT lives.
783,I can't imagine anything ever wanting to live there.
784,Can we stop talking about this
785,I can barely breathe
786,It's summer.
787,"we're kids, I can barely breathe"
788,having a fucking asthma attack
789,and fuck doing this.
790,What the hell Put the map back
791,What happened
792,What's going on
793,"I don't know, look"
794,guys
795,Georgie.

801,Turn it off
802,"Yes, Turn it off"
803,"Run, Stanley"
804,What is that
805,What's up
806,"Thanks, Ben."
807,IT saw us
808,IT saw us and It knows where we are.
809,IT always knew.
810,"Alright Stan, so let's go."
811,Go
812,Go where
813,Neibolt.
814,That's where GggGeorgie is.
815,After that
816,"Yeah, it's summer, we should be outside"
817,If you say it's summer one more ffffucking time
818,Bill
819,Wait
820,"""He tttthrusts his fists"
821,"""Against the pppost"""
822,"""and still insists he sees the gggghost"""
823,Bill
824,"Bill, you can't go in there."
825,This is crazy.
826,"Look, you don't have to come in with me,"
827,"but what happens when another Georgie goes missing,"
828,or another Betty or another Ed Corcoran or one of us
829,Are you just going to pretend it didn't happen like everyone else in this town
830,Because I can't.
831,"I go home and all I see is that Georgie isn't there,"
832,"his clothes, his toys, his stupid stuffed animals"
833,but he isn't.
834,So walking into this house
835,for me
836,it's easier that walking into my own.
837,Wow.
838,What
839,He didn't stutter once.
840,Wait
841,"Uhhh, shouldn't we have some people keep watch,"
842,just in case something bad happens
