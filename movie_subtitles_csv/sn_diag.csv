199,but i like the idea of comparing two people together.,119,MARK,8
200,it gives the whole thing a very turing feel,120,MARK,8
201,since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit,120,MARK,8

210,first up is kirkland.,133,MARK (V.O.),10
211,they keep everything open and allow indexes in their apache configuration.,134,MARK (V.O.),10

213,kids' stuff.,139,MARK (V.O.),10

216,i can run an empty search,151,MARK (V.O.),12

241,they link to a php that redirects or something.,191,MARK (V.O.),15

252,"it's slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time,",201,MARK (V.O.) (CONTÂ||D),15
